Pardot automation assignment to develop a test suite.  Tasks are as follows:

* Log in to Pardot
* Create a list with a random name (Marketing > Segmentation > Lists)
* Attempt to create another list with that same name and ensure the system correctly gives a validation failure
* Rename the original list
* Ensure the system allows the creation of another list with the original name now that the original list is renamed
* Create a new prospect (Prospect > Prospect List)
* Add your new prospect to the newly created list
* Ensure the new prospect is successfully added to the list upon save
* Send a text only email to the list (Marketing > Emails)  *Please note, email is disabled in this account so you will not actually be able to send the email.  This is okay.
